# rock-paper-scissors

This is a Rock, Paper, Scissors game that allows the user to compete against the computer

## Project overview

This project is divided into two main parts:

1. The first part focuses on building the **Rock, Paper, Scissors** game logic without a graphical user interface (GUI), allowing the player to compete against the computer.
2. The second part focuses on implementing user interaction between the player and the program.

This project showcases my proficiency not only in **writing functional JavaScript code**, but also in applying a structured **planning and problem-solving process**, which includes:

1. Understanding the problem
2. Translating it into plain English
3. Designing the algorithm and expressing it in pseudocode
4. Building the final program that runs on the computer

It also demonstrates my ability to use **developer tools** to interpret errors and debug potential issues efficiently during development.
